# Ideas

An _Idea_ is a type of immutable data stored in the [Idea-DAG][Idea-DAG].  An
Idea can either be a plain text document, or else a [Relation][Relations].  Plain
text Ideas can be thought of as the "leaves" of the Idea-DAG.

Ideas are referenced by their IPFS content IDs, which we often refer to as
`iCids` (Idea Content ID).
